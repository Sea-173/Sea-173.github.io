Research Experience
======
* Kai Yang lab, Tongji University, Apr 2022 -- Oct 2022, China
  * Research Topic: Developing a novel algorithmic framework to address bi-level programming problems using the cutting-plane method.
    * Derived the specific elaboration of the general algorithmic framework in the field of meta-learning.
    * Utilized PyTorch to complete the code implementation of the algorithm.
    * Reproduced the code from similar papers (ANIL, iMAML) and conducted a comparison with our method.
  * Result: The paper was published at ICLR 2023, and my experimental results were adopted.
* Kai Yang lab, Tongji University, Oct 2022 --  Now, China
  * Research Topic: Expanding the previous algorithmic framework to a distributed setting and incorporating gradient tracing and proximal gradient.
    * Completed the mathematical derivation of the algorithmic framework incorporating the proximal gradient.
    * Implemented the algorithm for meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization using the PyTorch framework.
    * Reproduced the code from similar papers and conducted a comparison with our method.
  * Result: Co-authoring a paper currently under submission to NeurIPS.
* SITP(Student Innovation Training Program), Tongji University, May 2021 --  May 2022, China
  * Research Topic: Designing a community travel system tailored for the visually impaired population.
    * Conducted on-site investigations and recorded the travel conditions of the visually impaired community.
    * Used the Huawei HarmonyOS development kit to create a smart sensing device.
  * Result: Developed a functional travel system and successfully completed the project.
