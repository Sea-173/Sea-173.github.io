I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Software Engineering](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My major is Software Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning.

I was fortunate to have participated in two research projects focused on distributed machine learning and optimization under the guidance of [Prof. Yang](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/10355.htm) from [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

You can find my CV here: [Haibo Zhao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/sea/Resume.pdf).

You can contact me through my [Email](mailto:2052535@tongji.edu.cn) or my [Wechat](../images/sea/wechat.png).
